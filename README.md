# Decision Tree based House Price Prediction
**Based on a Kaggle Machine Learning Course but _written by me_**

## Concepts included are:
  - Prediction Target Selection
  - Choosing Attributes/Features
  - Building the Model
  - Model Validation using Mean Average Error
  - Underfitting vs. Overfitting

**This model is not accurate as the MAE value is around 230k, I will be working on it 
to decrease the value as much as possible.**

_More updates to come_
